								<h2><strong>Beginning "IT career" story</strong></h2>
								<p>I began to have a passion for programming since the 8th grade when I first learned Pascal with algorithms from easy to difficult. After all, it's still just a subject that interests me a lot, my main subject is chemistry. I studied Chemistry until the 10th grade with my dream of going to Medical School. Once again the door to study abroad opened for me.</p>
								<p>I found it difficult to study medicine in Australia, so I moved to IT (At that time my IT level was still quite good). I changed my decision and switched over to IT, it was like a fate. And then I found my favorite university - RMIT. I had studied medicine at Monash University before but I had a hard time so I decided to change my studies.</p>
								<h2><strong>Future expectation</strong></h2>
								<p>I hope that with my current ability and with what I am training at RMIT University, I will soon achieve my dream, which is to find a satisfactory job at the companies I used to be dream of being devoted to. I hope that the teachers and friends at RMIT will join me in discovering and developing all my abilities.</p>
